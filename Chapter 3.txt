3.10 Compare if and while (Theory)
'if' is a single-selection control statement that executes a block of code once if the condition is true.
'while' is a looping control statement that keeps executing a block of code as long as the condition remains true.


3.12 Control statement combination (Theory)
Control statements can be combined using:
1. Nesting: Placing one statement inside another (e.g., if inside a loop).
2. Stacking: Writing multiple statements sequentially.
